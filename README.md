Project Description:-

To develop a comprehensive credit card dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

The project entails importing data from a CSV file into a MySQL database and then using Power BI to create dashboards that visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights. The project contains two PowerBI dashboards-

Credit Card Transaction Report: showing transactional data, providing insights on total revenue, interest, quaterly revenue trends and week-on-week growth

Credit Card Customer Report: showing customer demographics, the dashboard allows you to explore customer data filtered by gender from age distribution to income analysis, it offers valuable insights into customer behaviour

Key Features:-

1. Data Source: SQL database containing credit card transactions and customer data.
2. Tools Used: Power BI for data visualization and analysis, SQL for data management.
3. Data Processing: Data was imported into SQL, cleaned, and processed before being visualized in Power BI.
4. Insights: The dashboard provides insights into customer segmentation, transaction patterns, and financial health metrics.
5. Visualizations: Comprehensive charts, graphs, and KPI indicators to facilitate easy decision-making.
6. Automated Data Updates: The dashboard is connected to the SQL database, allowing for real-time data updates and dynamic reporting.

Insights:
From Week 1 (1st Jan 2023) to Week 52 (24 Dec 2023)

1. Overall Revenue is 55M
2. Total Interest is 7.84M
3. Total Tranasction Amount is 45M
4. Male customers are contributing more in revenue 30M, female 25M
5. Blue & Silver credit card are contributing to 93% of overall transactions
6. Overall Activation rate is 57.5%
7. Overall Delinquent rate is 6.06%

After the addition of Week 53 (31 Dec 2023):-
1. Overall Revenue is 57M
2. Total Interest is 8M
3. Total Tranasction Amount is 47M
4.  Male customers are contributing more in revenue 31M, female 26M

Technologies Used:-
1. Power BI: Data visualization and reporting.
2. SQL: Data storage, processing, and cleaning.

Data collection:-

Data was collected from an online open-source platform. Then it was imported in the SQL server using PostgreSQL. After that the SQL server was connected to the Power BI. From there it was imported to the Power BI dashboards. If the SQL server data updates then the dashboard updates after refreshing the data in Power BI.
